# movie-DB-cleanup-notebook

This is a Jupyter Notebook detailing the process of cleaning a dataset about movies, as well as extracting insights and correlations from it.

The dataset includes movies from 1986 to 2020, and is kindly provided by [Daniel Grijalva](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies) on Kaggle, and [Alex the Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst) guided me through some of it.
